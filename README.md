# Corona Virus Tracker for USA

![termtosvg](./corona-tracker.svg)

Fetches and displays most recent data from the [Johns Hopkins Data Repository on Github](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
via the CLI. Output is displayed in the terminal. When `process.stdout` is detected to be a TTY, output will
be ANSI colorized and displayed in a UTF8 table, otherwise the script will output Markdown to simplify piping between
scripts or to a file.

The data shown includes total confirmed cases, deaths, and 1, 7, and 30 day deltas for each.
When viewing data for the entire USA, totals are calculated for each state. When viewing data for an individual state,
totals are shown per-county. In each case, the top row will display the combined total. Data in the table is sorted by
the total number of confirmed cases in descending order.
 
Data for Saturday, June 26, 2021 is shown below.
