# Corona Virus Tracker for USA

![termtosvg](./corona-tracker.svg)

Fetches and displays most recent data from the [Johns Hopkins Data Repository on Github](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
via the CLI. Output is displayed in the terminal. When `process.stdout` is detected to be a TTY, output will
be ANSI colorized and displayed in a UTF8 table, otherwise the script will output Markdown to simplify piping between
scripts or to a file.

The data set includes total confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. When viewing data for the entire USA, totals are
calculated for each state. When viewing data for an individual state, totals are shown per-county. In each case, the
top row will display the combined total. Data in the table is sorted by the total number of confirmed cases in
descending order.
 
Data for Wednesday, May 20, 2020 is shown below.

## Installation
